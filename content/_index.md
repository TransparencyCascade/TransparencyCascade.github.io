# Transparency Cascade Press

**Investigative journalism documenting institutional capture, corruption, and threats to democratic accountability.**

---

## The Investigation

For 54 years, American democracy has been systematically captured—through dark money, judicial pipelines, regulatory revolving doors, and coordinated strategy. We document the mechanisms, name the actors, and trace the money.

Our work is grounded in documentary evidence, systematic verification, and the belief that transparency enables democratic renewal.
