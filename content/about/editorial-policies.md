## Core Principles

### 1. Seek Truth and Report It

We are committed to accuracy in all that we publish.

- **Verify before publishing.** Use original sources whenever possible.
- **Provide context.** Facts without context can mislead.
- **Distinguish fact from analysis.** Clearly separate verified facts from interpretation.
- **Hold power accountable.** We prioritize stories exposing wrongdoing by those with power.

### 2. Minimize Harm

We balance the public's need for information against potential harm to individuals.

- **Respect privacy rights.** Private individuals have greater privacy interests than public figures.
- **Consider vulnerable subjects.** Exercise heightened sensitivity with victims and minors.
- **Avoid sensationalism.** Present serious matters with appropriate gravity.

### 3. Act Independently

Our primary obligation is to the public.

- **Maintain editorial independence.** No funder or external party has input into editorial decisions.
- **Avoid conflicts of interest.** Disclose any unavoidable conflicts.
- **Refuse gifts and special treatment.**

### 4. Be Accountable and Transparent

We explain our processes and correct our errors.

- **Publish our standards.** These policies are publicly available.
- **Explain our methods.** Describe how information was gathered and verified.
- **Correct errors promptly.** Mistakes are corrected fully, quickly, and prominently.

## Request for Comment

Before publishing any story that portrays an individual or organization in a negative light, we provide a meaningful opportunity to respond.

**Minimum effort:** At least five documented attempts through multiple channels.

**Timing:**
- Breaking news: 24-48 hours
- Standard investigation: 3-5 business days
- Complex investigation: 1-4 weeks

**Documentation:** We log all contact attempts with date, time, method, and outcome.

## Corrections Policy

We correct errors promptly, fully, and transparently.

- **Corrections** are clearly labeled at top of article
- **Clarifications** explain additional context
- **Updates** note significant new information

We do not unpublish articles except in extraordinary circumstances.

## Source Standards

**Documentary evidence prioritized:** Government records, court filings, corporate disclosures, contemporaneous documents.

**Two-source rule:** Controversial claims require at least two independent sources.

**Anonymous sources:** Used rarely, only when information is vital and unavailable on-record.
