# About Transparency Cascade Press

## Mission

Transparency Cascade Press produces investigative journalism documenting institutional capture, corruption, and threats to democratic accountability. Our work is grounded in documentary evidence, systematic verification, and the belief that transparency enables democratic renewal.

## What We Cover

**Institutional Capture** — How regulatory, judicial, media, and political institutions have been captured by private interests through dark money, personnel placement, and coordinated strategy.

**Financial Networks** — Offshore finance, dark money flows, and the infrastructure enabling elite impunity.

**Epstein Network** — Ongoing investigation into the intelligence, financial, and political dimensions of the Epstein case, drawing on thousands of documents from House Oversight and DOJ releases.

**Surveillance Infrastructure** — Tracking the deployment of surveillance technology with connections to intelligence services.

## Methodology

We maintain a verified timeline database of 3,000+ events, cross-reference multiple document sources, and publish our research tools as open source to enable independent verification.

**Source Standards:**
- Primary documents prioritized (court filings, government records, corporate disclosures)
- Multiple independent sources for controversial claims
- Anonymous sources used rarely and only when necessary

**Verification:**
- Every event in our timeline includes source citations
- All claims can be independently verified
- Corrections published promptly and transparently

## Editorial Policies

We adhere to the [Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics](https://www.spj.org/spj-code-of-ethics/) and model our standards on ProPublica, OCCRP, and ICIJ best practices.
